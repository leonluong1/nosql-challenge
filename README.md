# UK Establishments Data Analysis
Module 12 NoSQL Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining UK food establishments including their name, location and ratings . We have python notebooks that contain starter code for the analysis. We took data from a json file and put that data into a Mongo database. We analyzed the data to answer meaningful questions.

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my NoSQL, MongoDB and Pymongo knowledge. I imported the json data into MongoDB and wrote queries to clean the database on a Python notebook. Then, I answered several questions about the data and put those answers into dataframes.

The file types in this repository are a json file and ipynb files.
